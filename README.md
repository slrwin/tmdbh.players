Players for TheMovieDb-Helper that support ACTIVE Kodi 19/20/21 Add-ons (updated as of Oct 28 2023) 

If any are broken, or not listed please let me know. I will look at it and let you know what I can or can't do. 
I can usually create a player for add-ons built as forks of either Exodus, Shadow, Fen or Venom as it's simply a matter of copying existing code. To create a player from scratch I would need the help of a true coder.

Enter this URL into TheMovieDb-Helper settings for players: https://bit.ly/gplayers

You can also manually download single players, or the full zip file, and then copy players into the /players folder under your Kodi's /userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.themoviedb.helper 

Please Note: For some of the Auto-Play players, you need to have your add-on configured to it's Auto-Play settings, otherwise they may default to Source Select.

If you are updating a broken player that you previously reconfigured in any way, you must go back into the Helper settings and reset that player to defaults. Otherwise the Helper will continue to read the broken reconfigured player instead of the newer updated version. Once the new player is active, you can then go back in and reconfigure the new player to your own custom preferences. The Helper always reads the /reconfigured_players folder first which over-rides any matching players in the /players folder. 

I now have Kodi 21 Omega installed and the few players I've tried, work. If you have any issues, please let me know.
